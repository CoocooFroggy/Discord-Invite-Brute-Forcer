# Discord-Invite-Brute-Forcer

## Environment Variables

Set your token in an environment variable to `TOKEN`.

In a shell script to launch the bot, you can do
`export TOKEN=[token]`

## Building

Do `./gradlew shadowjar` in the project directory to make a jar file. Run it with `java -jar build/libs/Invite Brute Forcer-1.0-all.jar`.

Or use the Dockerfile.

## Usage:
Do `/brute` and fill in the arguments. 3 characters is probably the optimal amount without it taking months. 4 character insensitive is the limit before it takes over a year.
